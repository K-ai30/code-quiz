Code Quiz
Web APIs and JavaScript Fundamentals: Code Quiz

This project was created to begin to understand how to use JavaScript and Web APIs to create applications where end users can interact and engage.  The objective with this project was to begin to conceptualize and put into practice how to code basic quizzes or coding assessments with some decision making aspects on the part of the end user based off selections that the end user chose.  The challenges with this project were in developing multiple-choice questions that are responsive based on selections made by the user in answering the questions.  Additionally, there was an added layer in this project that influenced the challenges and complications.  Where this added layer shows up, is in the way incorrect answers chosen by the user decrease the amount of time the user has to respond to the question(s).
